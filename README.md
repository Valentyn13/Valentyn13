### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone, my name is Valentyn and I am 20 years old. I am a full-stack developer with 6 months experience. I am a calm, non-confrontational person who likes to be part of a team. As a team player, I always try to complete tasks efficiently and on time. Working with me, you can count on a reliable performer who doesnâ€™t look for excuses and performs assigned tasks. I always want to improve my skills, so I am able to learn independently and quickly. I always calmly accept criticism of my more skillful colleagues and open to conversation. I strongly believe that our cooperation will be productive!
